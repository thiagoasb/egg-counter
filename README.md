# Egg counter

- Has 2 states: state 1 when in "one egg image" and state 2 when in "many eggs image"
- Increments one to the counter when the user touch on screen
- Show secret number when holds touch on screen
- Change image to many eggs when the counter reaches the secret number
- Returns to initial state when the user click 3 times on the many eggs image
- The app can store the data (counter and secret number)
- [BUG] If the app is in final state and the user close the app, when returns it will show the first state and then will enter in final state again.
